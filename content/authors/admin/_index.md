I am a field ecologist with broad interests in ecology, evolution, and conservation biology. My main research aims to understand how human-induced disturbances impact biodiversity. I began with my research interests on birds in Eastern Himalayan, where I studied life history of alpine birds, including the Fire-tailed Myzornis and Fire-tailed Sunbirds. My PhD work looked at how urbanization affects stress responses and multiple dimensions of niche characteristics of sub-tropical bird communities in Southwest China. For my postdoc, I am working with Prof. David Wilcove to try to understand the extent and mignitude of illegal hunting of terrestrial vertebrates in China and the combined effects of hunting or by-catch on populations of birds, especially those birds migrate along the East Asian- Australasia Flyway.

Prior to Princeton, I received my PhD degree in Zoology from Sun Yat-sen University (2018), and received my master degree in Zoology (2015) and my bachelor degree in Wildlife and Nature Reserve Management (2012) from Southwest Forestry University in China.
